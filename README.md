# Handwritten_digit_recognizer_MNIST
A Python based program which recognizes handwritten numbers from 0-9 using neural network

Using a neural network with 3 hidden layers with 512,256,128 neurons respectively, we trained our model using the MNIST_data. The input layer will have 784 neurons (28*28 image so 784 pixels in total). The final output layer will have 10 neurons as we have 10 classes (0-9 digits). 

With a live prediction at the end, this project is mainly for educational purposes.
